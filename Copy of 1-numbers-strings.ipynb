It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"sqWvKQMU9jrH"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sudPX7lX2lVy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# data_science = '''_____'''"],"metadata":{"id":"M4ekh-5x2lVz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g8DIfhZ_9jrH"},"source":["##### **Exercise 9:**\n","How many characters are there in `data_science`?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"q6gDSO3E9jrH"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3HgxHRd62-Pz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# _____(data_science)"],"metadata":{"id":"0mSxvgDG2-P2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cnXae6C19jrI"},"source":["##### **Exercise 10:**\n","Convert all of the `data_science` characters to lower case and save it to a variable called `data_science_lower`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VsUPsobG9jrI"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6TzzIfs_3PF6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_lower.asp\n","\n","# _____ = data_science._____()"],"metadata":{"id":"UAQ_6EDi3PF7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M2ig3CBO9jrI"},"source":["##### **Exercise 11:**\n","How many times does the word \"data\" appear in the string you converted to lower case?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"d3xnrIw69jrJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"p8qzKZPc31lH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_count.asp\n","\n","# data_science_lower._____(\"data\")"],"metadata":{"id":"bvlNhKML31lI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sqLnagdM9jrK"},"source":["##### **Exercise 12:**\n","Split the string into sentences whenever there is a fullstop (`.`)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IiV2QyrT9jrK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hrHy6yZs4HXq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp\n","# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_rsplit.asp\n","\n","# data_science._____(\". \")"],"metadata":{"id":"KetTTKlY4HXr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EesNFTTO9jrK"},"source":["##### **Exercise 13:**\n","Capitalise the first letter of every word in the string and save it to the variable `data_science_capital`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kpZGn0NK9jrK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"u7_L5I8q5B8S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_title.asp\n","\n","# data_science_capital = data._____()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZXUq7q3X5B8T"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1uTXO2NB9jrK"},"source":["##### **Exercise 14:**\n","Find the index of the word \"Turing\" in the string and save it to the variable `index`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"HuV6OUsQ9jrK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###### **Hint**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"W_l5JPj45DKz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_index.asp\n","\n","# index = data_science._____(\"_____\")"],"metadata":{"id":"thlTwd7p5DKz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QY5ao8e09jrK"},"source":["## Formatting with f-strings\n","\n","Strings can be concatenated with `+`.
